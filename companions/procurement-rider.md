# Procurement Rider
*Attach this to RFPs, MSAs, or task orders to require Brake & Turn compliance.*

**Core vendor obligations**
1. Publish a Transparency Map (redactable if sensitive).  
2. Provide energy mix disclosures and a renewable plan.  
3. Enable human-in-the-loop controls + audit trails.  
4. Support open exports (prompts, logs, fine-tunes, embeddings).  
5. Complete the [Living Checklist](/companions/living-checklist) with a minimum baseline score agreed by the buyer.  
6. Run annual alignment tests and share a short alignment report.  
7. Accept independent audit rights and reasonable rate-limit local inference.

**Evaluation weighting (suggested)**  
- Openness & interoperability (25%)  
- Energy stewardship & local impact (20%)  
- Alignment + safety evidence (20%)  
- Total cost of ownership (15%)  
- Accessibility & human approval UX (10%)  
- Community/workforce benefit (10%)
