# 🧭 The Gigawatt Race  
**AI Infrastructure Expansion and Energy Stewardship**

**Source:** [Distilled Earth — “These Data Centers Are Getting Really, Really Big”](https://www.distilled.earth/p/these-data-centers-are-getting-really)

---

### Context
This assessment reviews the explosive growth of gigawatt-scale data centers—projects like OpenAI’s *Stargate* facility in Abilene, Texas—and evaluates their alignment with the **Brake & Turn Compact**.  
While such sites symbolize engineering ambition, their unchecked energy consumption and rapid centralization reveal how easily AI infrastructure can diverge from stewardship and public accountability.

---

### Summary Findings
- **Scale without proportionality:** 1.2 GW capacity rivals half a regional utility’s output.  
- **Energy opacity:** no public renewable disclosure or lifecycle planning.  
- **Governance vacuum:** development outpaces regulation and oversight.  
- **Labor imbalance:** temporary construction booms without sustained community benefit.  
- **Cultural impact:** speed and spectacle replace ecological and civic continuity.

**Average Alignment Score:** **1.4 / 5  ⚠ Severe misalignment — extractive trajectory**

### Recommendations
1. **Ethical Pre-Build Review** — Apply the [Living Checklist]({{ site.baseurl }}/companions/living-checklist/) before grid or zoning approval.  
2. **Energy Disclosure & Offset** — Require transparent power-mix reporting and renewable commitments.  
3. **Community Oversight Councils** — Include local stakeholders in ongoing governance.  
4. **Public Audit Registry** — Publish environmental and ethical performance scores.  
5. **Compact Clause Integration** — Reference the [Procurement Rider]({{ site.baseurl }}/companions/procurement-rider/) in federal or state AI infrastructure contracts.
